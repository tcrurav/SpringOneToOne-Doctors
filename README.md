# Spring RESTfull Basic example of One to One Relationship

It's just that... A simple project to demonstrate the use of Spring in a basic example with a One to One Relationship.

## Getting Started

For the initial steps give a try to my following video:

It's a step by step guide to understand how to make a Spring project implementing RESTFul and JPA accessing MySQL.

For the theory envolving One-to-one relationships in Spring I recommend you:
https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-one-to-one

After that clone this project and try it.

The Postman Documentation is shown in the following screenshot:

The resulting registers in the database are shown here:
